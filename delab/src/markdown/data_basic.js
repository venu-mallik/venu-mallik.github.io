| Type             | Distributed processing framework              | Structured Query Language               | In-memory data analysis and manipulation library |
| Language         | Scala, Java, Python (PySpark)                 | ANSI SQL                                | Python                                           |
| Data Size        | Handles Big Data                              | Works well for medium-sized data        | Limited by system memory                         |
| Scalability      | Highly scalable horizontally                  | Limited scalability                     | Not scalable                                     |
| Distribution     | Distributed processing across clusters        | Typically single-machine processing     | Single-machine processing                        |
| Execution        | Lazy (operations defined, executed later)     | Eager (operations executed immediately) | Eager (operations executed immediately)          |
| Data Persistence | HDFS, S3, local files                         | Relational databases                    | Local files, memory                              |
| Learning Curve   | Steeper due to distributed computing concepts | Easier to learn, familiar for SQL users | Easier to learn for Python users                 |
| Use Cases        | Large-scale data analytics, machine learning  | Data querying, reporting                | Data exploration, cleaning, manipulation         |
| SQL Integration  | Spark SQL provides SQL-like interface         | Built-in                                | Limited SQL-like functionality (query method)    |
