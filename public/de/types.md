This table compares various processing paradigms based on their primary use cases, data models, access patterns, query languages, data volume handling, latency characteristics, consistency guarantees, scalability approaches, typical data sources, common use cases, and example systems or frameworks.

OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) systems are optimized for handling high volumes of read/write operations with low latency and strong consistency (ACID) guarantees, making them suitable for transactional applications like e-commerce and banking.

OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems are designed for read-intensive analytical queries on large multidimensional datasets, typically used for business intelligence and reporting.

HTAP (Hybrid Transaction/Analytical Processing) systems combine the capabilities of OLTP and OLAP, allowing for transactional and analytical workloads on the same system.

Real-time processing systems handle low-latency ingestion and processing of event streams, often used in IoT and fraud detection scenarios.

Stream processing systems continuously ingest and process unbounded data streams, providing low-to-medium latency and various delivery semantics (at-least-once, exactly-once). Common use cases include log processing and real-time monitoring.

Batch processing systems are optimized for large-scale data processing on bounded datasets, typically used for data transformation, ETL, and machine learning model training.

Ad-hoc processing systems allow for interactive, exploratory queries and analysis on various data sources, often used for ad-hoc reporting and data exploration.

The choice of processing paradigm depends on factors such as the required data model, access patterns, latency requirements, consistency guarantees, scalability needs, and the specific use case (e.g., transactional processing, analytical processing, real-time event processing, batch data transformation, ad-hoc analysis).
